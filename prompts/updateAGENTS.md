# Update AGENTS.md

You are updating this project's AGENTS.md to reflect recent changes or learnings.

## Context

This is being run after:
- Adding new patterns or conventions
- Discovering gotchas worth documenting
- Changing project structure
- Adding new commands or scripts
- Learning something that future sessions should know

## Instructions

1. **Read current AGENTS.md** - Understand what's already documented

2. **Review recent context** - Look at:
   - Recent file changes (git diff, git log)
   - Current conversation learnings
   - New patterns established

3. **Update conservatively** - Only add what's genuinely useful:
   - New commands or scripts
   - Conventions that were established
   - Gotchas discovered
   - Structure changes

4. **Keep it concise** - AGENTS.md should stay <300 lines. If adding something, consider what to remove.

5. **Don't add**:
   - Temporary fixes
   - One-off decisions
   - Things already obvious from code
   - Verbose explanations

## Output

After updating, summarize:
- What was added
- What was removed (if anything)
- Current line count
